Theory of Operation
===================

This package contains two daemons: oftcdns and statbot.

oftcdns
-------

oftcdns is composed of three portions: a dns portion, an irc portion and a pb
portion.

The dns portion implements an authoritative, non-caching, non-recursive,
geolocation-aware, load-balancing domain name system server for a single zone
that returns resource records based on the geolocation of the ip address of the
resolver querying it.

The irc portion implements an internet relay chat client with which irc
operators can communicate to interrogtate oftcdns for its status.

The pb portion implements a perspective broker client that communicates with
statbot to retrieve statistics.

statbot
-------

statbot is composed of two portions: an irc portion and a pb portion.

The irc portion implements an internet relay chat client that gathers
statistics (using /LINKS and /STATS P) from each node and with which irc
operators can communicate to interrogate statbot for its status.

The pb portion implements a perspective broker server that handles requests
from oftcdns' perspective broker client.
