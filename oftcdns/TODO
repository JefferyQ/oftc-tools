 - learn about which regions exist from ip2ga.cidr
 - support multiple targets (irc, irc6, possibly more in the future)
 . support IPv6
 - make base and SOA settings configurable
 - per target and region load a "zone" from disk
   - zones can contain (for now) A, AAAA, and TXT records
   - whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
   - whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 - on HUP reload zones and geo ip map
 - how to do logging?  syslog?  no, use twisted's stuff
 - make internal rewritten label not predictable
 - support querying of targets as if the request came from a certain region,
   for instance <TARGET>-<REGION>.<BASE> (e.g. irc-eu.geo.oftc.net).
