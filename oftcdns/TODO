 D learn about which regions exist from ip2ga.cidr
 - make SOA settings configurable
 - per target and region load a "zone" from disk
 D whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
 D whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 - on HUP reload zones and geo ip map
 - make internal rewritten label not predictable
 - support querying of targets as if the request came from a certain region,
   for instance <TARGET>-<REGION>.<BASE> (e.g. irc-eu.geo.oftc.net).
