To Do List
==========

Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        d Deferrable
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 - on HUP reload zone files, ip2region.dat, and yaml configuration file
 - allow config file to be given on the command line.  relying on environment variables makes weasel sad
 . write a sanity checker for the config
   o schema.yaml written; use kwalify to validate
   - whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
   - whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 . increase documentation in README
 - do we keep track of how many users are using v4 and v6 on a single server?
   if not we should and add that info the pool output
 - be more push than pull for stats to keep snotes noise low etc
   - set client to +c to determine connects/exits to keep track of user counts
   - use /version to determine 'availability'
   - use stats P, /lusers, /map on start/post split to determine actual user count data
     - use stats P only for determining ipv4/6 distribution
 - say on IRC when we connect to statsbot/lose connection to statsbot, or
   get/lost connections from oftcdns clients
