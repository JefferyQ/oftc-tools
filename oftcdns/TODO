Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        d Deferrable
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 D learn about which regions exist from ip2ga.cidr
 D whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
 D whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 D on HUP reload zones and geo ip map
 D make internal rewritten label not predictable
 - remove magic strings and numbers
 - what if STATS P returns multiple rows with port 6667, one for ipv4 and another for ipv6, say?
