To Do List
==========

Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        d Deferrable
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 - on HUP reload zone files, ip2region.dat, and yaml configuration file
 X make internal rewritten label not predictable
 o when the zonefile ("geo.oftc.net") is empty we get a backtrace upon queries
 o I needed to link var/oftcdns/ip2region.dat into lib.  why?  note --localstatedir option to configure
 - allow config file to be given on the command line.  relying on environment variables makes weasel sad
 . write a sanity checker for the config
   o schema.yaml written; use kualify to validate
   - whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
   - whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 - increase documentation in README
 - please make TTL of the TXT record match the other TTLs
 - asking it for things it doesn't know about (like www.example.com) will give you
   a NXDOMAIN instead of a "go ask the root servers"
 - can make install not overwrite my config file?
 - is it reasonable to add the client IP into our TXT response?  can we also
   add the server's name?
 - per server config option to not ever list it if it has more than n users.
   for instance: do not return xenon if it has more than 900 users (since its ulimit -n is 1024).
 - can the order of the records that are returned be randomized?
