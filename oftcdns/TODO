To Do List
==========

Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        d Deferrable
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 D learn about which regions exist from ip2ga.cidr
 D whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
 D whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 D on HUP reload zones and geo ip map
 D make internal rewritten label not predictable
 o when the zonefile ("geo.oftc.net") is empty we get a backtrace upon queries
 o I needed to link var/oftcdns/ip2region.dat into lib.  why?
