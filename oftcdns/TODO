The To Do List
==============

Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        d Deferrable
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 D learn about which regions exist from ip2ga.cidr
 o make SOA settings configurable
 o per target and region load a "zone" from disk
   (zones can be configured in yaml file)
 D whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
 D whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 - on HUP reload zones and geo ip map
   (the question is not whether this is a good idea but whether
   a python/twisted application accepts HUP... and how to tie to it)
 - make internal rewritten label not predictable
   (some rand() thingy, maybe)
 o support querying of targets as if the request came from a certain region,
   for instance <TARGET>-<REGION>.<BASE> (e.g. irc-eu.geo.oftc.net).
   (already exists but is of form eu-irc.geo.oftc.net... easily changed)
 - consider merging v4 and v6 stuff together; radix supports it; IPy supports it
   so why process them independently in oftcdns.mak
