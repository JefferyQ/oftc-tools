To Do List
==========

Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        d Deferrable
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 - on HUP reload zone files, ip2region.dat, and yaml configuration file
 - allow config file to be given on the command line.  relying on environment variables makes weasel sad
 . write a sanity checker for the config
   o schema.yaml written; use kualify to validate
   - whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
   - whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
 - increase documentation in README
 o asking it for things it doesn't know about (like www.example.com) will give you
   a NXDOMAIN instead of a "go ask the root servers"; returns correct response, now,
   for an authoritative-only, non-caching, non-recursing server
 - is it reasonable to add the client IP into our TXT response?  can we also
   add the server's name?
 - can the order of the records that are returned be randomized?
 o BUG: asking for a label that doesn't exit doesn't yield NXDOMAIN:
	weasel@intrepid:~$ dig @gns3.oftc.net irfc6f.geo.oftc.net 
	;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0
	;; QUESTION SECTION:
	;irfc6f.geo.oftc.net.           IN      A
	;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
	geo.oftc.net.           7200    IN      SOA     dns.geo.oftc.net. hostmaster.geo.oftc.net. 1 3600 300 1209600 1800

 farer future:
  - do we keep track of how many users are using v4 and v6 on a single server?
    if not we should and add that info the pool output
