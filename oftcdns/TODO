To Do List
==========

Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        d Deferrable
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 - on HUP reload zone files, ip2region.dat, and yaml configuration file
 - make internal rewritten label not predictable
 o when the zonefile ("geo.oftc.net") is empty we get a backtrace upon queries
 o I needed to link var/oftcdns/ip2region.dat into lib.  why?  note --localstatedir option to configure
 - allow config file to be given on the command line.  relying on environment variables makes weasel sad
 - write a sanity checker for the config
   - whine if there is a zone that we do not think we need
   - whine if there is no zone for a region we think we need (remember global/fallback zone)
