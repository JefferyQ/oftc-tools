OFTC Munin plugins
==================

irc_: Runs on the management host and uses the druby service to query
connections via IRC network messages. This plugin also queries the IRC servers
running on non-OFTC-managed hardware.

irc: Runs on the hybrid server host and uses "ss" to count connections
separated by ipv4/6 and ssl/non-ssl.

ircmemory: Report RSS/VSZ for prod/testnet hybrid.
